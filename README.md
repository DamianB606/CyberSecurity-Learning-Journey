# CyberSecurity-Learning-Journey
This repository documents my progress through platforms such as TryHackMe and future personal projects.  
It contains notes, tools, and key takeaways from rooms and labs Iâ€™ve completed, with a focus on:

- Linux fundamentals  
- Networking and security basics  
- Cryptography concepts  
- Hands-on cybersecurity labs (TryHackMe, penetration testing paths, etc.)

The goal of this repo is to track my progress, build a reference for myself, and showcase my practical learning journey as I prepare for a placement year in 2026.
