# Cyber Security Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress in cybersecurity through platforms such as TryHackMe, HackTheBox and future personal projects.  
It currently focuses on HackTheBox academy, going through the **Penetration Tester Job Role Path**, and **HTB Labs**.

## Roadmap
- Continue updating **HackTheBox.md** as I complete new modules  
- Once I reach more advanced modules within the **Penetration Tester Job Role Path**, i will begin adding:
  - Write-ups for challenging rooms/labs that are worth showcasing  
  - Personal projects and experiments in cybersecurity tools

This way, the repository will grow from basic foundations into a full record of my technical learning and hands-on skills.
