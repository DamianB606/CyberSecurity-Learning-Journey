# Cyber Security Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress in cybersecurity through platforms such as TryHackMe and future personal projects.  
It currently focuses on the Cyber Security 101 path, building foundations in Linux, networking, Windows, and security basics.  

## Roadmap
- Continue updating **progress.md** as I complete new modules  
- Once I reach more advanced paths (e.g., Penetration Tester), I will begin adding:
  - Structured notes and study files in dedicated folders (Linux, Networking, Web, Exploitation, etc.)  
  - Write-ups for challenging rooms/labs that are worth showcasing  
  - Personal projects and experiments in cybersecurity tools  

This way, the repository will grow from basic foundations into a full record of my technical learning and hands-on skills.
