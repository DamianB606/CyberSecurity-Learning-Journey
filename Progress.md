# Progress Tracker â€“ TryHackMe Cyber Security 101 Path

## âœ… Completed Modules

### 1. Start Your Cyber Security Journey
- Learned about the fundamentals of offensive and defensive security  
- Practiced basic information gathering techniques  
- Gained awareness of common roles within cyber security  

### 2. Linux Fundamentals
- Built familiarity with the Linux operating system  
- Practiced navigating the file system, managing files/directories, and using common commands
- Learned how to schedule recurring tasks with the use of crontabs

### 3. Windows and Active Directory Fundamentals
- Explored Windows OS basics and security concepts 
- Explored built-in Microsoft security features such as Windows Security and BitLocker 
- Understood how Active Directory structures accounts and permissions  
- Learned about system configuration, resource monitoring, Windows registry, and UAC settings 

### 4. Command Line
- Practiced essential Bash commands in Linux  
- Used Windows Command Prompt and PowerShell for system interaction  
- Learned about shell scripting and how it can be used to automate log searching and other iterative tasks
  
### 5. Networking
- Learned the OSI model and TCP/IP protocol suite, including how data flows through each layer
- Covered core networking concepts: IP addressing, routing, and packet delivery
- Explored key protocols: DHCP, DNS, ARP, ICMP, TLS, SSH and VPN
- Understood how port numbers change when moving from insecure to secure protocols (e.g., HTTP -> HTTPS, SMTP -> SMTPS)
- Secure protocols use TLS encryption to protect data in transit
- Practiced packet analysis in Wireshark to observe protocol behaviour and network traffic

## ðŸš§ In Progress
- Next room to be covered: tcpdump (command-line packet capture and filtering)

## Current Focus
I've currently decided to pause my progress in TryHackMe and instead, move onto HackTheBox and prioritise **HTB Academy Penetration Tester Job Role Path**.
My reasoning is simple: HackTheBox content revisits the same foundational concepts but teaches them in a more hands-on approach, which i find helps me learn faster and retain skills.
I still plan to return to **Cyber Security 101 Path** on TryHackMe in the future, both for completeness and making sure there are no gaps in my learning.
Once I complete my HTB path, I will be uploading my **Certification Of Completion** and any **badges earned** on **LinkedIn** as a verifiable proof of progess.
