# Cyber Security Learning Journey
This repository documents my progress across multiple cyber security learning platforms, including **TryHackMe** and **Hack The Box**.  
It tracks my development from foundational concepts through to hands-on labs and job-role-based learning paths.

## Current Focus
I’m currently focused on the **SOC Analyst** job role path on Hack The Box, applying concepts from earlier Penetration Tester modules to defensive operations, log analysis, and incident response.

## Structure
- **TryHackMe.md** – progress on the Cyber Security 101 path (paused midway while focusing on Hack The Box)  
- **HackTheBox.md** – main progress tracker including completed modules, labs, and ongoing SOC Analyst learning
