# HackTheBox progress tracker
Tracking my journey through HackTheBox academy & labs as I continue developing practical cyber security skills.
I began with the **Penetration Tester** job role path to build a foundation in offensive security and gain exposure to real-world attack techniques.
This repository documents completed modules, labs, and progess updates as I expand my knowledge across different areas of cyber security.
## Pentetration Tester Job Role Path
### Modules Completed
- Pentration Testing Process (15/15 sections)
- Getting Started (23/23 sections)
- Network Enumeration With Nmap (12/12 sections)
- Footprinting (**In progress...**)  
## HTB Labs
### Starting Point
- Tier 0: Completed 8/8 labs
- Tier 1: Completed 5/8 **In progress...**
## Pivot to SOC Analyst Job Role Path
After progressing through the beginning/foundational Penetration Tester Job Role Path modules, I realised that while offensive security provided valuable insight into attacker methodology, my interests and long-term goals allign more with **defensive operations** and **threat detection**.
I've therefore pivoted to the **SOC Analyst** job role path on HackTheBox to build hands-on experience with blue-team practises such as:
- Log analysis and event correlation
- Incident response workflows
- SIEM monitoring and alert triage
- Threat intelligence fundamentals

This section will track my ongoing progress and learning outcomes as I develop a stronger focus on defending systems and identifying real-world attack patterns.
